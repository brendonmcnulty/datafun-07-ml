# DataFun-07-ML
Brendon McNulty

## Module Goal
In this module, we begin a guided machine learning project. We create and manage a professional workflow using GitHub for version control, VS Code for development, and JupyterLab for exploration and analysis.

We'll use predictive analytics and introduce machine learning concepts while following a repeatable, professional data workflow.

## Project Setup Steps

### 1. Create and Clone the Repository
Created a new GitHub repository named **datafun-07-ml** with a default README.md.  
Cloned the repository to the local folder:


### 2. Add Common Project Files
Added `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` to define dependencies and ignored files.

**.gitignore includes:**
.venv/
pycache/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
.vscode/
data/

**requirements.txt includes:**
jupyterlab
numpy
pandas
pyarrow
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy


### 3. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
Created and activated a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:


### 4. Launch JupyterLab
Launched JupyterLab to begin analysis and machine learning exploration:
